sec4Heading: Why do I need a Pet Policy if I have a "No Pets Policy"?
sec4Text: The Federal Housing Administration allows a person with a disability
  that can get a letter from a qualified professional to have an animal in
  almost any rental, regardless of a “No Pets Policy”.  Millions of ESA
  (Emotional Support Animal) letters are faked every year. We have a thorough
  verification process that will expose these fake letters and keep unauthorized
  animals out of your rental!
