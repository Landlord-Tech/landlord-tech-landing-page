faqHeading: Frequently Asked Questions
faqList:
  - question: How long does it take to get set up?
    answer: If you have your property address information, tenant name and email,
      and a payment method, you can have your first contract sent to your tenant
      in 5 minutes or less.
  - question: Do you have an ESA letter verification process?
    answer: Yes, we have a state of the art ESA letter verification process that
      exposes fraudulent letters. We also include all state laws and penalties
      for fraudulent documentation in the contracts that the tenants read and
      sign.
  - question: Do I need this service if I have a “No Pets Policy”?
    answer: You would especially want this service if you have a “No Pets Policy”.
      With dozens of companies popping up online offering ESA Letters for as low
      as $29, the number of fraudulent ESA letters have skyrocketed this past
      year. More people are sneaking in pets as they are working from home and
      think they can conceal them better. There are instances where HUD will
      hire people to inquire about support animals and press a lawsuit if you
      are not following their rules exactly. We are here to help take on all of
      these burdens for you!
  - question: Do you have pet policies for every state?
    answer: Our goal is to have policies for every state before the end of 2021.
      Currently supported states are Idaho, Utah, Montana, Nevada.
  - question: If my tenants have already signed a pet policy, can I implement this
      pet policy?
    answer: You can always let your tenants know you have decided to use our
      platform to help facilitate the pet policy and ask them to sign up. They
      have the right to decline. However, if they are asking to have an
      Emotional Support Animal, a Service Animal, or even if they have a visitor
      that wants to bring an animal onto the leased premises, you can let them
      know that you use our platform for those purposes and they would need to
      get approved before doing so.      You can also customize your policy for
      your property ahead of time. When the new lease is ready to sign all you
      would have to do is enter the tenant name(s) and email/phone number and
      click send.
