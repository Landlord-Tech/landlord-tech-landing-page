testimonialTitle: What Property Managers Have to Say

  - review: As an on-site manager I have pets walk by me all day and with over 200
      units there is no way I can try to look those animals up in our regular
      software. With OurPetPolicy and the Pet Mapping App, it is so fast and
      easy to find if an animal is registered and the maintenance staff has
      access as well.

  - review: We were having issues with identifying pets and didn’t have a good way
      to verify Emotional Support Animals. After looking at all of the options
      available, OurPetPolicy has the most useful tools included in their
      software package and is the best fit for us. They are great in working
      closely with our staff and following up with our tenants, which takes a
      lot of work off of our property managers.

  - review: I’ve been in the Multi-housing space for 2 decades now, and animals are
      always a headache to deal with for property managers and property owners.
      By giving the property managers tools to be successful at managing these
      pets by quickly identifying them, having all assistance animals properly
      vetted, and being able to see that data in real-time, is invaluable.
