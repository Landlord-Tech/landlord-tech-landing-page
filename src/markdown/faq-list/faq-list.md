    faqQuestion: " What do I do if I have questions? "
  - faqAnswer: >-
      You can always let your tenants know you have decided to use our platform
      to help facilitate the pet policy and ask them to sign up. They have the
      right to decline. However, if they are asking to have an Emotional Support
      Animal, a Service Animal, or even if they have a visitor that wants to
      bring an animal onto the leased premises, you can let them know that you
      use our platform for those purposes and they would need to get approved
      before doing so. 


      You can also customize your policy for your property ahead of time. When the new lease is ready to sign all you would have to do is enter the tenant name(s) and email/phone number and click send.
    faqQuestion: If my tenants have already signed a pet policy, can I implement
      this pet policy?
  - faqQuestion: Do you have pet policies for every state?
    faqAnswer: Our goal is to have policies for every state before the end of 2021.
