Situated in the picturesque state of Utah, a sizable property housing 572 units grappled with some persistent challenges related to pet management. With a myriad of pets and emotional support animals (ESAs) across the units, the management faced hurdles in streamlining the onboarding process, spotting unknown pets, identifying potentially fraudulent ESA letters, converting non-paying pet owners, and keeping track of all documentation without human-errors.

## The Solution: OurPetPolicy

To tackle these challenges, the property turned to OurPetPolicy, a [comprehensive pet management platform](https://landlordtech.com/products) offering a suite of services.

> I just like having the organization of having everything in one place, like when tenants move, or a paper gets lost, it’s all just electronic and automatic. I like being able to look at OurPetPolicy and see okay this person has XYZ animals and see all of their information. Or there’s been cases where someone’s like ‘oh the owner of a brown pitbull always lets their dog poop and never picks it up’ and now I can go in and see oh ‘brown pitbull,’ that’s tenant X.

### **ESA Verification**

By leveraging OurPetPolicy's ESA Verification, the property could efficiently verify the authenticity of emotional support animals' letters, helping in rooting out fraudulent claims.

### Pet Mapping

With the help of [Pet Mapping](https://landlordtech.com/resources/new-pet-mapping-tool-feature-added-to-pet-management-platform-ourpetpolicy/), the property could precisely identify and keep track of the animals present, streamlining the entire pet management process.

### Pet Management Platform

The centralized OurPetPolicy platform provided an all-in-one solution for tracking, managing, and onboarding pets, which drastically reduced human-error and lost documentation.

### Pet Curriculum

Through our specialized Pet Training Curriculum, residents can learn about responsible pet ownership, leading to happier pets and reduced property damage.

### The results following the adoption of OurPetPolicy were nothing short of transformative

### Financial Upswing

The property witnessed a surge in the number of pets paying fees, leaping from 75 to 146. This transition brought about an impressive yearly revenue increase of $46,505, rendering a remarkable 317% ROI.

### Efficient ESA Management

There was a notable decrease in the number of assistance animals from 75 to 46, thanks to the rigorous ESA verification system.

### Enhanced Tracking

Post-implementation, the property could account for 192 known animals, a rise from the initial 150, ensuring that each pet was adequately managed and cared for.

### The Bottom Line

Landlord Tech and the [OurPetPolicy](https://landlordtech.com/products) platform have revolutionized the way properties, such as the one in Utah, approach pet and ESA management. The comprehensive platform not only alleviated the immediate challenges faced but also brought about significant financial benefits, making it an indispensable tool for properties aiming for efficient, streamlined, and profitable pet management. 

> Before we were in the red quite a bit, and so this has definitely boosted our pet income, which is good. It’s definitely helping that area. \[OurPetPolicy] has a lot of perks. I like that you have them sign the pet addendum through there. Something that gets missed a lot is the pet addendum in move-in. And it’s all just in one place. Overall, we’re really happy with it.
