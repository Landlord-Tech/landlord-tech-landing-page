When it comes to maintaining safety and peace of mind in rental properties, pets are a real risk factor. That’s why pet screening is essential for property owners looking to keep everything running smoothly. Failure to [properly screen and manage pets](https://landlordtech.com/resources/best-practices-to-properly-screen-pets-for-apartments) can lead to various issues, from property damage to increased liability that no one wants to deal with. The following information will help avoid these pitfalls and ultimately lead to better pet-friendly rental properties.

#### Understanding the Importance of Pet Screening

In property management, it’s common practice to screen all potential tenants for traits like responsibility and respectability. [Pet screening](https://landlordtech.com/resources/five-tips-for-managing-pets-on-your-rental-properties) can be thought of as an extension of this. Pets, like their owners, have a range of risk profiles that can influence the living conditions of a property. Taking care to assess these properly can save you the headache of many different problems in the future.

> Screening software such as OurPetPolicy allows you to easily assess the potential risk a pet might pose based on proven factors.

These include behavior, size, breed, and health status. For example, aggressive behavior patterns and larger sizes have higher risk profiles. Furthermore, certain breeds have dispositions that lean towards aggressive or destructive behaviors. Other breeds have common health conditions that can become problematic in a shared living environment.

Beyond this, a comprehensive pet screening can also provide valuable insight into the pet owners themselves. It can help to reveal how responsible and committed they are to their pets, which can be helpful information. For example, knowing their pet training approach can reflect their sense of responsibility towards the building.
Identifying Aggressive or High-Risk Pets.

A critical part of the pet screening process is identifying pets that could pose a heightened risk. One of these is aggressive behavior, but this also includes unpredictable behavior. Pets with a history of aggression or belonging to specific or larger breeds may require a bit of extra attention or discussion with the owners to set up an appropriate strategy.

Using advanced pet management software like OurPetPolicy can help to accelerate this process significantly. The software offers easy to fill out an evaluation of each pet’s behavioral history, giving you an easy way to overview and assess the risks. By compiling comprehensive information on each pet’s past behavior, you can catch many red flags early, saving you a boatload of trouble down the line.

#### Preventing Property Damage

The pet screening gives you an accurate assessment of indicators that indicates potential problems before they become an issue.

> One of the main benefits of doing a comprehensive pet screening is [safeguarding your property from potential damage](https://landlordtech.com/resources/protecting-your-rental-property-from-pet-damage). 

For instance, large dog breeds, while often well-behaved, cause more wear and tear due to their size and energy levels. This can happen as damage to floors, doors, or garden areas, or by a variety of other means. Similarly, a pet with a history of destructive behaviors raises a big red flag for future damage to the building. Pet screening helps you to predict and anticipate these problems in advance so you get fewer nasty surprises.

#### Ensuring Compliance with Pet Policies

Even if you’ve done an excellent screening, there are other pet policies that can help. Enforcement of these rules can go a long way to keeping the property and its tenants safe. In addition, pet management software can help by certifying pets have their vaccinations and by checking for compliance with breed and weight restrictions.

On top of that, pet screening helps with ESA verification, which checks for the legitimacy of Emotional Support Animals and their certifications. This is important for the rights of ESA owners and the well-being of all residents.

Overall, [pet management software for properties](https://landlordtech.com/resources/pet-management-software-benefits-and-roi) like OurPetPolicy can help simplify this process. It keeps track of all these details, including the relevant risk levels and recommendations for what you may want to do about them. With this software, you can ensure you’re providing a secure living space for everyone on the property.

#### Mitigating Liability Risks

Besides just reducing property damage, pet screening plays a critical role in mitigating liability risks. The verification process ensures pet owners have the appropriate pet insurance, a measure that shields property owners from potential legal consequences. While no one ever wants their pet to do harm, it is a risk factor that must be considered when renting to a tenant with a pet that has the potential to hurt someone. 

With [comprehensive pet screening](https://landlordtech.com/resources/five-tips-for-managing-pets-on-your-rental-properties), you can catch potential liability problems early on. This includes pets with aggressive behavior or uncovering gaps in a pet’s vaccination records. By using this information, you can pre-emptively address issues. 

#### Creating a Peaceful Living Environment

On a more general note, pet screening can help create a more peaceful living environment for all residents. By nipping potential pet problems in the bud early on, there is less of a chance of a pet-related disruption. 

Responsible pet ownership is also encouraged by pet screening.

> Owners will be more aware of what is expected of them and prepare their pets in advance with vaccinations, training, and other means of compliance, such as [ESA verification](https://landlordtech.com/resources/seven-ESA-loopholes-commonly-used-by-tenants-and-how-to-close-them). 

By getting pet management software for properties, you are ensuring each of these facets is covered. It’s a proactive approach that will pay dividends in the long run, when conflicts are minimized and a comfortable living environment is secured.
