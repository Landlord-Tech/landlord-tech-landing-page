On September 7th, Logan Miller, the dynamic co-founder of OurPetPolicy, led an insightful webinar for the [IREM NY chapter](https://iremalbany.org/). The focus was crystal clear â€“ shedding light on [the process of ESA verification](https://landlordtech.com/resources/what-landlords-need-to-know-about-esas-in-2023/) Given the rampant misinformation and the proliferation of dubious online ESA letters, there's a pressing need for genuine information. Logan's session honed in on how to discern legitimate online ESA letters from the fakes and provided guidance on remaining compliant with the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations.

IREM, renowned for its commitment to ethical property management and real estate practices, found an ally in OurPetPolicy. Both organizations value the importance of adhering to legitimate processes, particularly when it concerns ESA verifications.

With the combined expertise and dedication of both IREM and OurPetPolicy, we anticipate many more collaborations on the horizon. Our shared goal is clear: to promote fairness, inclusion, and legitimacy in the world of real estate.
