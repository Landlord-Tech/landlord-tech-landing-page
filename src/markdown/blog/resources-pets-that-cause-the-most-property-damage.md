As long as [animals have been cohabiting with humans](https://landlordtech.com/resources/animals-in-rentals-in-2023), they’ve been causing property damage. Whether it’s something as minor as an “accident” in the corner of the room or complete destruction of furniture, our furry companions seem to love creating headaches for both their owners and property managers. Some landlords have sworn off allowing pets on premises due to the potential damage that may occur, but that’s not always the best solution.

Allowing pets on a property can help increase the prospective [tenant pool](https://landlordtech.com/resources/boost-income-and-cover-damage-expenses-with-a-pet-guarantee) and allow leasers to earn more revenue through [pet fees](https://landlordtech.com/resources/why-pet-fees-are-an-essential-landlord-strategy). And while it is unavoidable, such damage caused by cats and dogs can also be heavily mitigated with the right pet policy and protections in place. Understanding what to expect and what breeds are more likely to cause loss and destruction can help you prepare and set appropriate boundaries. 

**Cats Can Cause Property Damage Too**

While cats are generally less hyperactive than dogs, they can still cause their fair share of property damage, especially if they are left unattended for too long. Cat urine carries a strong smell, and untended litter boxes can cause the smell to permeate the property long after a resident leaves. If urine winds up imbedded in carpeting, pricey deep cleaning or removal/replacement may be necessary.

Cats are also natural-born climbers and scratchers. Tall furniture, curtains, screens, blinds, and even walls are no match for them if they want to reach a certain spot or cure an itch to scratch. While scratching posts can help to keep the urge at bay, it’s still wise for residents to cat-proof select furnishings and consider the material of household objects and where they are placed.

Out of 100 renters in a complex, at least 15 will be allergic to cats. Nearly twice as many people are allergic to cats than dogs, and cat hair and dander is known to stick and linger. Even after a tenant moves out and the apartment is cleaned, there’s a risk of an allergic reaction to future tenants occupying an apartment where the cat recently lived.

**Dog Breeds to Watch Out For**

Dogs can wreak havoc in homes and apartments, especially if they are not properly trained. And with more dogs than cats living as pets, there’s just a naturally greater chance of property damage occurring. The amount and type of damage that can occur does vary widely, however. Some breeds are more likely than others to chew, bark, and bite. Here are the breeds that are most likely to cause the most damage to your property.

**• Chihuahua:** While small, chihuahua’s have a big bite. They love to chew anything from furniture and carpeting to shoes and toys. If left to be bored and alone, be wary of what might be torn up after a day unattended.

**• Mastiff:** The Mastiff is one of the largest breeds of dog in the world. While gentle and mild-tempered, its sheer size can make it a household risk. Mastiffs are prone to knock things over and cause damage to furnishings. They are also very affectionate dogs and can easily overwhelm visiting toddlers and children. 

**• Basset Hound:** Although unassuming in appearance, Basset Hounds love to bark. While not physical damage, excessive barking can disturb neighbors and create an overall inhospitable environment for tenants. 

**• Whippet:** Similar to Greyhounds, Whippets are very active and excitable animals. They will follow their owners around and jump on furniture. If they do not get enough exercise outside, they will expend their energy inside instead.
