Once the policy is finalized, it’s important to communicate it to both current and prospective residents. This can be done through a pet addendum to the lease agreement and by having tenants read and sign off on the new rules.

## Marketing Your Pet-Friendly Policy

Permitting pets will instantly attract new tenants, but you need to invest in getting the word out.

This can include community events or activities that pet owners can participate in, such as dog-walking groups or pet-themed social events. Not only can this help to create a sense of community and camaraderie among pet owners, but they’ll also be more likely to stay long term.
