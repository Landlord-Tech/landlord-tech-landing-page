Demand for pet-friendly rentals has soared in recent years. More than ever before, tenants are seeking out rental options that openly welcome pets on property and foster pet-friendly communities. While accepting pets can help attract demand, property owners and managers need to also ensure that these furry residents are the right fit for their communities. That’s where [pet screening](https://landlordtech.com/resources/tips-for-establishing-a-software-pet-screening-process-in-apartments) comes into play.

[Properly screening all pets](https://landlordtech.com/resources/enhancing-apartment-living-with-pet-screening) ensures that your property is protected from potential damage and that tenants enjoy a safe and harmonious living environment. Allowing any animal to live on property without guidelines in place can lead to potentially dangerous situations. This post details the considerations that property managers need to keep in mind when implementing a pet screening policy.

## Ensuring Compatibility and Safety

This includes evaluating a pet's history, temperament, and training. Pet management software can help in this evaluation by streamlining the screening process. These tools facilitate the collection and storage of information such as vaccination records, behavioral assessments, and owner references. They can also assist in tracking compliance with [pet policies](https://landlordtech.com/resources/the-true-cost-of-having-a-bad-pet-policy/), ensuring that pet-owning tenants uphold their responsibilities in accordance with community guidelines.

> Property owners should prioritize screening to ensure that all [pets living on the property](https://landlordtech.com/resources/emotional-support-animals-service-animals-and-pets-whats-the-difference/) are well-behaved, non-aggressive, and won't cause unnecessary damage or disruption.

## Establishing Pet Policies

Ironclad pet policies set expectations for tenants by outlining the dos and don’ts of pet activities in your rental community. These policies should detail what is considered acceptable behavior for pets, such as noise levels, waste cleanup, and leash requirements. By establishing such guidelines, property owners can mitigate potential issues and conflicts down the road. When crafting pet policies, [landlords should consider breed restrictions](https://landlordtech.com/resources/pets-that-cause-the-most-property-damage/), size limits, and a cap on the number of pets allowed per unit. Pet management software can help enforce these policies by automatically notifying tenants of their responsibilities and helping property owners track compliance and issue reminders or warnings when necessary.

## Gathering Accurate Information

When tenants first bring pets onto the property, it's essential to obtain specific details in order to ensure a complete and accurate profile of the animal. Be sure to at least collect information on the pet's breed, age, size, and behavioral history. The use of digital forms and pet management software can greatly streamline this collection process. Professional tools allow pet owners to easily submit required documents and information online, reducing the risk of missing or incomplete forms. Property owners can access this data in real time, ensuring up-to-date records and enabling a quicker response to any concerns.

## Communicating With Tenants

Regular communication and [education about responsible pet ownership](https://landlordtech.com/resources/new-pet-training-tool-feature-added-to-pet-management-platform-ourpetpolicy/) are essential for maintaining a harmonious pet-friendly rental community. By keeping pet-owning tenants updated and informed, your property team can help reinforce expectations, prevent misunderstandings, and ensure that tenants and pets coexist peacefully. Pet management software can serve as a great vehicle to get the word out. Many applications include the ability to distribute guides on pet care and etiquette, update residents on any policy changes, or offer information on local pet-friendly activities and services. Platforms such as OurPetPolicy even offer responsible pet owner training modules as part of their out-of-the-box solution.

## Implementing Screening Procedures

Screening pets before their paws hit the property is the best way to maintain a safe and harmonious pet-friendly environment. After an application is submitted, the typical screening process involves several steps, including an assessment of the animal’s behavior, a reference check (prior landlords, neighbors, etc.), and a review of documentation/records. Although important, this process can be tedious when done manually. [Pet management software](https://landlordtech.com/resources/top-pet-management-software-features-for-properties/) can support features designed to streamline the intake of documentation. It can also flag incomplete or missing information and create a digital repository for easy reference in the future as needed.

## Utilizing Pet Management Software

Whether you’re looking to convert to a pet-friendly community or exploring solutions to better manage your property’s pet policy, pet management software can help. It simplifies and streamlines what can often be a complex and time-consuming process.

> The right solutions can help property managers efficiently collect and organize pet-related information, centralize documentation for easy reference, establish channels of communication between tenants and landlords, and even [verify ESA claims](https://landlordtech.com/resources/the-landlords-essential-guide-to-esas/).
