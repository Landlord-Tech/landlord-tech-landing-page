Boise, ID, June 7, 2022 – **Landlord Tech**, creators of the industry leading property management software OurPetPolicy, announced today the addition of their new Pet Mapping Tool to the platform. The feature will allow property owners, managers, and on-site staff better manage pet-related issues throughout their properties.

“As we looked into what the next features of OurPetPolicy would be, we quickly realized that pet mapping was what our focus needed to be,” Landlord Tech Co-Founder Logan Miller said. “Identifying Animals quickly is a game-changer for owners and managers as they’ll now be able to easily solve the issues of complaints and unauthorized animals in a simple and easy-to-use system.”

The new Pet Mapping Tool in OurPetPolicy is designed to efficiently manage all pet-related issues including waste management, animal complaints, and authorized animals. The tool logs all pets who have been properly documented on an occupant’s lease, which allows all staff to identify animals in a matter of seconds. With advanced search functionality, property managers will be able to quickly differentiate between authorized and unauthorized animals, identify which pet is causing problems and assign corrective action, if necessary.

The staggering growth in the last quarter coupled with continued development are guiding a clear path to success for the brand. Site improvements and upgrades fueled by customers’ feedback emphasize the care and effort OurPetPolicy puts into their approach.
