    infoBlockHeading: Manage Pet and Assistance Animal Requests
    infoBlockContent: ‘Fraudulent ESA letters are a growing problem in residential
      real estate. Over 50% of ESA letters are fraudulent. With lost pet rent,
      no pet deposit, pet damage, and problems with tenants not following pet
      rules, improper management of fake ESAs can result in huge losses to
      property owners and headaches for property managers.
